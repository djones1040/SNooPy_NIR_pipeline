Running these tests requires the pytest module:

pip install pytest

Note that if you are running SNooPy in a virtual environment, you need to use
the pip located in that virtual environment to install pytest, otherwise, it
won't be able to load SNooPy's modules for testing.

Simply run 'pytest' in this folder. These test scripts should run with no 
errors.
